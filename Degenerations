Degenerations (english version of a quebecois song)
Transcribed the version by The Stylites

Your great great grandfather cleared a little piece of land
Your great grandfather helped to plow the field by hand
and your grandfather took it, made it grow, and made it thrive
and your father sold it off and took a steady 9 to 5

As for you young man in the city all alone
in a one bedroom loft winter chills you to the bone
when you dream at night you feel the shovel in your hand
as you walk the fields
that little piece of land

Well Now your great-great grand mum she had 14 kids to raise
and then your great grand mum nearly followed in her ways
and your grandmother had three and decided to prevent
and your mom had just the one: you're her happy accident

as for you great-great granddaughter it's your body to delight
and if accidents happen you can exercise your right 
but in the silent morning you can almost hear the sound
of a big kitchen table 
with all the children gathered round

your great grandfather's dad was a depression era man
and your grandfather's dad counted pennies in the hand
and thank god your grandad became a millionaire
and your dad retired early to live off of his share

as for you young man you owe your soul to Uncle Sam
you can't even get a loan and nobody gives a damn
so to fight the temptation to commit armed robbery
you keep reading books about how to embrace a life of simplicity

your great-great grandmum and dad they knew how to throw it down 
and your great grand mum and dad they went a swinging through this town
and your grand mum and dad they sang twist and shout all night
mom and dad met at a disco did you know 
it was love at first sight?

as for you my friend how do your evenings go
can you break away from the television glow
some things never change under any circumstance
put your new shoes on kid
cause we're going out to dance
