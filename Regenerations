Régénérationes (english version of a quebecois song)
Baesd on a Transcribed version by The Stylites of the song Dégénérationes

Your great great grandfather cleared a little piece of land
Your great grandfather helped to plow the field by hand
and your grandfather took it, made it grow, and made it thrive
and your father sold it off and took a steady 9 to 5

As for you young man in the city all alone
in a one bedroom loft winter chills you to the bone
when you dream at night you feel the shovel in your hand
as you walk the fields
that little piece of land

Well Now your great-great grand mum she had 14 kids to raise
and then your great grand mum nearly followed in her ways
and your grandmother had three and decided to prevent
and your mom had just the one: you're her happy accident

as for you great-great granddaughter hope and praying every night
for the babe you've always dreamed of hoping IVF goes right
but in the silent morning you can almost hear the sound
of a big kitchen table 
with all the children gathered round

your great grandfather's dad was a depression era man
and your grandfather's dad counted pennies in the hand
and thank god your grandad became a millionaire
and your dad retired early to live off of his share

as for you young man you owe your soul to Uncle Sam
you can't even get a loan and nobody gives a damn
so to fight the temptation to commit armed robbery
you keep reading books about how to embrace
a life of simplicity

Now your great kitchen table has been marked by many crayons
just like your grandmum's adorned by little hands
No longer a dream there's a shovel in his hand
though its smaller than a spade 
his children eat the things he plants

For my dear great-great-great granddaughter I have these words to say
You're inheriting our mess and the world is yours to save
I can feel the fear and pride as your parents hold you tight
We're rooting for you kid. I hope
everything turns out alright
