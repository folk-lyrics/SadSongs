# SadSongs
Repository for collecting lyrics of sad folk songs, including rewrites of lyrics that have not aged well

Some songs may be newer and under copyright
Some may be in public domain

Typically in the folk tradition, sharing lyrics and singing live are appreciated methods for keeping the tradition alive, and these lyrics are compiled, tinkered with, and shared in that spirit.
